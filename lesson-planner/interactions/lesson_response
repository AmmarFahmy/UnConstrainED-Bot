# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Statistics (Grade 12)

## Duration: 50 minutes

### Objectives:
- Students will comprehend the basic concepts of mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- Students will be able to calculate these statistical measures for a given data set.

### Pre-requisites:
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Understanding of data and information

### Anticipatory Set (5 minutes)
- Begin with a question: "Why do you think it is important to summarize data?"
- Briefly discuss the role of statistics in various fields such as sports, science, and economics.

### Instruction (20 minutes)

#### Mean (5 minutes)
- Define mean as the average of a set of numbers.
- Demonstrate calculation on a simple data set.
- Provide a clear example with steps written on the board.
  
#### Median (5 minutes)
- Explain that the median is the middle value of a data set.
- Model finding the median for both odd and even number of data points.
  
#### Mode (5 minutes)
- Define mode as the most frequently occurring value in a data set.
- Show examples with one mode, more than one mode, and no mode.

#### Standard Deviation (5 minutes)
- Introduce standard deviation as a measure of spread in the data.
- Simplify the concept by discussing variability and how it relates to the mean.
  
### Guided Practice (15 minutes)
- Provide students with small data sets to work on in groups.
- Circulate the room, offering support and using questioning to assess understanding.
- For the student with dyslexia, offer data sets printed on colored paper with clear, large fonts and step-by-step guided instructions.
- Use visual aids and consistent color coding for different statistical measures.

### Independent Practice (5 minutes)
- Have students complete a worksheet with several different data sets requiring calculation of mean, median, mode, and a conceptual question about standard deviation.

### Closure (5 minutes)
- Review key points: definitions, calculation methods, and their significance.
- Ask volunteers to share solutions to the worksheet and discuss any common errors.

### Assessment and Evaluation:
- Check for understanding through responses during guided practice and review of worksheet answers.
- Observe student participation and problem-solving strategies during group work.
  
### Differentiation:
- For the student with dyslexia, instructions and examples will be provided in written and oral format, and worksheets will have a clear layout with adequate space for calculations.
- Offer additional visual aids and hands-on activities to reinforce concepts.

### Follow-up:
- Assign a homework task that includes finding and summarizing data from a chosen article or source.
